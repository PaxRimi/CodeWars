Hello everyone! 
In this repository I plan to add one file every single day with my answer for a Kata form https://www.codewars.com. 
At this moment when I write this I have a 7'th Kyu, so I will be working with a Kata on the same level. 
When I level up to 6 Kyu and over in repository shows folder for exercises on correct level. 

At every file at the top in comment is contents of exercises, and below is my code with answer.
Obviously this code must pass every test from codewars site. 

Thanks for reading. 
Have a nice day!
